**Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine**

**About the Project**

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various physiological factors. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used due to its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The dataset, diabetes.csv, contains records of patients with their corresponding physiological features and diabetes status.

**Built With**

- Python
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
